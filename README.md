# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
A project for the Ustacky's Data Scientist Microdegree

# Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

In this project, data science & analytics skills were employed to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

# Data Collection
The data source is divided into different parts, and you will combine the data to perform analysis and provide insights.

1. The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) monitors the country’s COVID-19 situation, and releases data on metrics across all the 37 states in the country. From NCDC COVID-19 official website, the data was obtained by performing a web extraction or web scraping.

2. The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries. The daily data for Nigeria was accessed from their repository and related insights were derived. Steps on how to do this will be provided in the starter code.

3. Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data
The vulnerability index was computed by considering several factors such as socio-economic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc, these factors are known as themes. Each theme was broken into subthemes, and data was gathered from them to compute the overall vulnerability index score by weighing equally each theme. You can use the index data with datasets related to the pandemic such cases, deaths etc to determine relationships and correlations in your analysis.
Note that:
- The term “vulnerability” refers to the impact of the virus on a community after the virus arrives.
- It ranks from Very Low(0) to Very High(1+)

4. Real Domestic Gross Product Data
Data was provided on the Real Domestic Gross Product(GDP) data for Nigeria. This will help you determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. You can achieve this by comparing the Real GDP(Pre-COVID-19) with Real GDP(During COVID-19).

5. State Budget Data
States across the country reduced their initial budget due to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. We have provided you with data on this, and you can also use this to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.

6. Our World in Data(OWID)
 Data was extracted from the OWID official website as an external data to compare the insights to other insights derived from other data used above.
 
# Suggestions on future work/Improvement plans
1. Ability to get data, analyse and generate insights on the breakdown of the effect on the socio-economy per states like effect of COVID 19 on 
- Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Education
- Employment rate and effect on each job sectors
2. Ability to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the project to design a model to predict the effect and opportunities of COVID 19 in the next few years
